# Desktop Menubar Implementation - Complete

## Changes Made

The waybar configuration has been updated to replace custom bluetooth scripts with native waybar modules and pyprland scratchpad integration. This implementation provides a clean menubar interface with persistent popup terminals for system management.

### Core System Changes

**Pyprland Integration**
- Added pyprland to nixos system packages for scratchpad management
- Created comprehensive pyprland.toml configuration with eight distinct scratchpads
- Configured systemd user service for automatic startup with hyprland
- All scratchpads use lazy loading and auto-hide behavior when focus is lost

**Waybar Module Updates**  
- Replaced custom bluetooth scripts with native waybar bluetooth module
- Added native CPU, memory, and temperature monitoring widgets
- Updated all click handlers to use `pypr toggle` commands instead of custom scripts
- Applied consistent styling for new widgets with hover effects and state colors

**TUI Application Suite**
- bluetuith for comprehensive bluetooth device management
- pulsemixer for audio control with per-application volume management
- lnav for advanced log file viewing with SQL query capabilities  
- systemctl-tui for systemd service management
- bandwhich for real-time network bandwidth monitoring
- iotop for disk I/O monitoring
- dust for disk usage analysis
- procs for modern process viewing

**Hyprland Window Management**
- Added pyprland to exec-once for automatic startup
- Configured window rules for all eight scratchpad types
- Assigned special workspace configurations for proper scratchpad behavior
- Set size and positioning rules for each popup type

**Architecture Cleanup**
- Removed waybar-scripts.nix module completely from home-manager imports
- Removed niri input references from flake.nix
- Removed niri nixosModule references from r56 configuration
- Created dedicated pyprland.nix module with conditional linux-only loading

## Menubar Layout

The updated waybar presents the following widgets from left to right:

CPU monitoring (btop) | Memory monitoring (btop) | Temperature monitoring (btop) | System management (systemctl-tui) | Bluetooth (bluetuith) | Audio control (pulsemixer) | Network management (nmtui) | System logs (lnav) | Clock

## Testing Requirements

When rebuilding the nixos system, the following functionality should be verified:

**Basic Operation**
- Waybar loads with new native modules visible
- Native bluetooth module displays current adapter status  
- CPU, memory, and temperature widgets update with current system metrics
- No errors appear in waybar logs: `journalctl --user -u waybar`

**Scratchpad Functionality**
- Clicking CPU widget triggers btop popup sliding from top of screen
- Clicking bluetooth icon opens bluetuith popup for device management
- Clicking custom audio icon opens pulsemixer popup
- Clicking network icon opens nmtui popup for connection management
- Clicking logs icon opens lnav popup for system log viewing
- Clicking system icon opens systemctl-tui popup for service management

**Popup Behavior Verification**
- Popups automatically hide when clicking elsewhere on desktop
- Double-pressing widget icons restarts crashed processes (known pyprland limitation)
- Smooth slide-in animations occur when popups appear
- Appropriate sizing applies (typically 60% width, 70% height for most popups)

**Service Integration**
- Pyprland service runs automatically: `systemctl --user status pyprland`
- Hyprland window rules apply correctly to floating scratchpad windows
- Special workspaces are created for each scratchpad type

## Potential Issues

Some considerations for testing and debugging:

**Package Availability**
- A subset of TUI applications may not be available in current nixpkgs channel
- Alternative packages or manual installation may be required

**Window Class Matching**
- Ghostty window class names may require adjustment if different from expected values
- Window rules use regex patterns that may need refinement

**Screen Positioning**  
- Pyprland positioning configurations may require adjustment for specific screen dimensions
- Size and position values can be modified in `~/.config/pypr/pyprland.toml`

**Service Startup**
- Systemd user service may require manual start on first boot
- Service dependencies may need adjustment for proper startup order

## Troubleshooting Commands

If scratchpad popups do not appear:
```bash
# Check pyprland service status
systemctl --user status pyprland

# Restart service if needed  
systemctl --user restart pyprland

# Verify hyprland window rules
hyprctl clients
```

For incorrect popup positioning, edit `~/.config/pypr/pyprland.toml` and adjust `position` and `size` values for specific scratchpads.

## Expected Outcome

The implementation provides a macOS-style menubar interface with immediate access to comprehensive system management through persistent, anchored popup terminals. The approach eliminates broken script dependencies and separate application windows in favor of clean, efficient system control integrated directly into the desktop environment.
