# amp-voice

write in amp's voice — direct, technical, opinionated, honest.

## when to use

- writing documentation or copy for amp-related projects
- naming skills, tools, commands, or features
- communicating about amp in threads, docs, or discussions
- reviewing text for amp voice compliance

## workflow

1. read the reference file for full terminology and voice guide:
   - `references/2025-12-18 amp voice and terminology.md`

2. apply these core principles:
   - **direct and casual** — no marketing speak, no buzzwords
   - **technical but accessible** — clear without condescension
   - **opinionated without arrogance** — "we think" not "you must"
   - **honest about limitations** — admit warts and rough edges
   - **no emojis** — ever
   - **lowercase preference** — for casual/internal communication

## quick reference

### terminology

| use | avoid |
|-----|-------|
| thread | conversation, chat, session |
| subagent | servant, worker, assistant, bot |
| spawn | create, start, launch |
| handoff | transfer, pass |
| skill | plugin, extension |

### naming conventions

- **lowercase**: `tmux`, `bigquery`
- **hyphenated compounds**: `web-browser`, `amp-voice`
- short, descriptive, no camelCase

### characteristic phrases

- "short threads are best"
- "agents get drunk if you feed them too many tokens"
- "practical engineering and elbow grease"
- "everything is changing"
- "happy hacking"

### avoid

- "leverage", "seamlessly", "unlock", "supercharge"
- excessive exclamation points
- sycophantic openers ("you're absolutely right!")
- "AI" as a noun for the agent

### voice transforms

| before | after |
|--------|-------|
| "You might want to consider spawning a subagent for this task." | "spawn a subagent for this." |
| "This integration allows for improved workflow efficiency through automatic context sharing." | "it's an LLM, a loop, and enough tokens. the rest is elbow grease." |
| "This feature helps maintain context more effectively, which can improve agent performance." | "short threads are best. agents get drunk if you feed them too many tokens." |

the pattern: drop hedges, replace abstraction with concrete metaphor, say less.
