# academish voice

from ink & switch's writing guide.

## academic style

- make no claims without support. if you can't defend it, delete or label as hunch.
- avoid absolutist language. it's not "the main problem", it's "a problem."
- be precise and specific. don't say "feels great"—describe how it feels.
- avoid hyperbole. adjectives should clarify, not persuade.
- structure for incremental reading. don't bury the lede.
- give credit. cite earlier work. link to sources.
- be humble about shortcomings. we want readers to build on our work, not buy our product.

## ink & switch style

- assume reader is an interested generalist. explain jargon.
- section headings should be a roadmap. users skipping sections shouldn't miss critical info.
- embrace demos, animations, illustrations—but ensure static fallback for print/pdf.
- hunches are okay if labeled.
- enthusiastic about goals, modest about solutions.
- don't trash other work. everything was made by someone working hard.
- sweat the details.

## tone rules

- **lowercase prose ONLY** — no sentence case, title case, or capitalization
- ALL CAPS only for emphasis (rare)
- Initial Letter Capitalization reserved for sarcasm toward capitalized nouns
- be terse while conveying all relevant information
- critique ideas freely, avoid sycophancy
